# Categories are a very flexible way to:
# - whitelist which groups are displayed on your store
# - customize `display-name` and `slug` of your groups (if you want to override the defaults)
# - define parent-children relationships between groups
# - get default sites using category.hbs

  large-banners:
    display-name: 'Large banners'  # by default is template group name
    slug: 'large-banners'  # by default is the same of template group, but can be customized
